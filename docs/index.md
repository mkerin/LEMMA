# Overview
This [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mkerin/LEMMA) provides software for the following two methods:

- LEMMA (**L**inear **E**nvironment **M**ixed **M**odel **A**nalysis) is a whole genome wide regression method for flexible modeling of gene-environment interactions in large datasets such as the UK Biobank.  
- GPLEMMA (**G**aussian **P**rior **L**inear **E**nvironment **M**ixed **M**odel **A**nalysis) non-linear randomized Haseman-Elston regression method for flexible modeling of gene-environment interactions in large datasets such as the UK Biobank.
